## Questions for Review

1. **Legal Content:** Should we use template legal pages or get legal review?
2. **Contact Form:** Email service preference? (Supabase Edge Function, SendGrid, Resend?)
3. **Categories Page:** Static or dynamic with real-time product counts?
4. **Mobile Dashboard:** Slide-out sidebar or bottom nav?
5. **Launch Timeline:** When is target public launch date?
