## Known Issues / Tech Debt

### Critical Issues (Launch Blockers)
1. **Missing Legal Pages:** No Privacy Policy or Terms of Service
   - Impact: HIGH - Legal requirement for GDPR/CCPA compliance
   - Risk: Cannot launch publicly without these
   - Fix: Create comprehensive legal pages (Priority 0)

2. **Missing Base Pages:** About, Contact, Categories, Trending pages don't exist
   - Impact: HIGH - Footer links are broken
   - Risk: Poor user experience, broken navigation
   - Fix: Create all base pages (Priority 0)

3. **Dashboard Mobile Responsiveness:** Sidebar doesn't work on mobile
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Dashboard unusable on mobile devices
   - Risk: ~50% of users can't access dashboard features
   - Fix: Add hamburger menu and mobile layout (Priority 0)

### Minor Issues
4. **Sitemap Warning:** Dynamic server usage error during build (non-blocking)
   - Impact: Low - sitemap still generates correctly
   - Fix: Add `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to sitemap route

5. **ESLint Warnings:** 3 minor unused variable warnings
   - Files: `dashboard-sidebar.tsx`, `review-card.tsx`, `search-actions.ts`
   - Impact: None - cosmetic only
   - Fix: Remove unused variables or prefix with underscore

6. **Development Tool Fields:** Not all development detail fields have UI display
   - Impact: Low - data is stored but not prominently displayed
   - Fix: Add remaining fields to development details tabs

7. **Dashboard Statistics:** Vote counts may not update in real-time
   - Impact: Low - statistics may lag slightly
   - Fix: Add real-time updates or cache revalidation

8. **Contact Form:** No email integration yet
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Contact form will collect data but not send emails
   - Fix: Implement Supabase Edge Function or email service integration

### Future Considerations
- Consider migrating to Supabase Realtime for live updates
- Evaluate need for Redis caching layer at scale
- Consider implementing rate limiting for API routes
- Explore AI-powered recommendations using OpenAI
