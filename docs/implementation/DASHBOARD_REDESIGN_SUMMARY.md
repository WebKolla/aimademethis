## Key Features Implemented

### Product Management
✅ View all products in grid layout
✅ See product statistics (views, votes, comments)
✅ Filter by status visually (published/draft badges)
✅ Quick edit access from multiple locations
✅ Delete products with confirmation
✅ Update all product fields
✅ Change product status
✅ Manage product images

### User Experience

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User accesses /dashboard/*
2. DashboardLayout checks authentication
3. If not authenticated → redirect to /login
4. Fetch user profile
5. Render sidebar with user info
6. Render page content
```

### Edit Flow
```
1. User clicks "Edit" on product
2. Navigate to /dashboard/products/[id]/edit
3. getProductForEdit() verifies ownership
4. Pre-populate form with existing data
5. User makes changes
6. updateProduct() saves with validation
7. Success → redirect to /dashboard/products
```

### Delete Flow
```
1. User clicks "Delete" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. If confirmed → deleteProduct() called
4. Delete product image from storage
5. Delete product from database
6. Success → redirect to /dashboard/products
```

## Database Schema (No Changes)
All existing product fields supported, including:
- Basic fields (name, tagline, description, etc.)
- Media URLs (video_url, demo_video_url)
- Development tools (ide_used, ai_models_used, etc.)
- Tech stack (tech_stack, mcps_used, etc.)
- Metrics (total_token_cost, development_time_hours, etc.)

## Migration Path

### For Users
- Old product submission link (`/products/new`) still works
- Can continue using existing routes
- Dashboard is opt-in (not forced)
- All existing products accessible

### For Admins
- Can deprecate old routes gradually
- Update links to point to dashboard
- No breaking changes

## Testing Checklist
